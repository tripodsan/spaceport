# SPACE PORT

**GBJam-11 Contribution - Theme: Space**

You play as Lyra the **space** dog who works in the port of a **space** station. Her job is to fill luggage containers optimally so that little **space** is wasted. Full containers need to be dispatched to the correct **space** dock where they will be loaded into the **space** shuttles for departure.
